When,in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes
I all alone beweep my outcast state
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
And look upon myself and curse my fate
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope
Featured like him, like him with friends possess'd
Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,
With what I most enjoy contented least
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising
Haply I think on the,and then my state
Like to the lark at break of day arising
From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate
For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
