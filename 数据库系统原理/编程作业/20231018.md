**Consider the employee database of Figure 4.12. Give an SQL DDL definition of this database. Identify referential-integrity constraints that should hold, and include them in the DDL definition.**



```sql
create table employee (
	ID int not null,
    person_name varchar(255),
    street varchar(255),
    city varchar(255),
    primary key (ID)
);

create table works (
	ID int not null,
    company_name varchar(255),
    salary int,
    primary key (ID),
    foreign key (ID) references employee(ID),
    foreign key (company_name) references company(company_name)
);

create table company (
	company_name varchar(255) not null,
    city varchar(255),
    primary key (company_name)
);

create table manages (
	ID int not null,
    manager_id int,
    primary key(ID),
    foreign key (ID) references employee(ID)
);

**Write an SQL query using the university schema to find the ID of each student who has never taken a course at the university. Do this using no subqueries and no set operations (use an outer join).**

```sql
select stu.ID
from student as stu 
     left outer join 
     attendance as att 
     on stu.ID = att.ID
where att.ID is null
```

`student` : students with ID

student (ID, ...) 



`attendance` : students who have ever taken at least one class at the university are recorded in the table 

attendance (ID, ...)
