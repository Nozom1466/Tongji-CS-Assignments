**Size Estimation**

The "joins" operation features with associative and commutative properties and we will consider the size based on $(r_1 \Join r_2) \Join r_3$. Due to the fact that the size of $r_1$ is smaller than that of $r_2$, which shares its primary key with a property in $r_1$, joining  $r_1$ with $r_2$ will yield a relation of at most $1000$ tuples. The same is ture for $r_2$ and $r_3$ and there will be at most $1000$ tuples in the joined relation becasue  $E$  is a key for $r_3$ .

Therefore, the final relation will have at most  $1000$ tuples.



**Efficient Strategy**

Since the joining operation will yield a minimum number of  relation $r_i$ , searching tuples from the the relation with a maximum of tuples  will be a better choice.  The $r_2$ will function as a pivot with $r_1$ and $r_2$ as its wings. Therefore, we will create an index on attribute $C$ for relation  $r_2$ and on $E$ fpr $r_3$ . Then we will do the following: 

For each tuple in $r_1$ , 

Use the index for  $r_2$ to look up AT MOST one tuple which shares the same  $C$ value in $r_1$

Use the index for $r_3$ to look up in $r_3$ AT MOST one tuple which has the identical value for $E$ in $r_2$.
